# Weather & AQI-Based Patient Alert System

This Python project fetches real-time **weather** and **air quality data** to alert patients with **chronic respiratory conditions** (like asthma and COPD) when environmental conditions may be risky for their health.

It combines data from:
- **NOAA National Weather Service (NWS)** for hourly weather forecasts
- **AirNow API** for daily AQI data

The system:
- Checks individual patient thresholds for temperature and AQI
- Generates condition-specific alerts
- Sends alerts via **email** (optional)
- Outputs the alerts in a clean CSV table
